# WXdotGOV

## Plan

This is meant to be a command application build in RUST

Should accept a location and return the weather forecast from a zip code or city & state from `api.weather.gov` using a geoencoded latitude and longitude using `nominatim.openstreetmap.org`.

## Resources

- `api.weather.gov`
- `nominatim.openstreetmap.org`


## Why?

I've been enjoying playing with Rust Lang and I figured: "why not make a terminal application from an open service like so many before me?"
